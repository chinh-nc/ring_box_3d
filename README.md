# First Three.js Project

This project is a simple application built using Three.js, a popular JavaScript library for creating 3D graphics on the web.

Three.js provides a set of features to create rich 3D applications, including rendering, scene graph, animation, cameras, lighting and shadows, etc.

In this project, we use Three.js to create a basic 3D scene, which can be a starting point for more complex 3D web applications.

## Dependencies

- three.js: ^0.161.0
- vite: ^5.1.2 (for development)
